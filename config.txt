This is website, but it's like console or terminal. You can:
$ help  -> know all functions RUS
$ list  -> know all directories in this score
$ cd    -> change directory
$ clear -> clear all console
$ color -> change color, first number is color for text and second for background, reset for set default colors
$ font  -> change text size, reset for set default size
$ new   -> create file --f or directory --d
"new --f test" - it's create new file in current directory, name is "test"
"new --d folder" - it's create new directory in current directory, name is "folder"
